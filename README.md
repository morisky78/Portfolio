## Description

This webpage is created to refactor the previous code to meet the standard rules for web accessibility. The index code has been changed with semantic HTML elements and alt attributes added to images. CSS is also modified to increase the efficiency.

## Usage

Please see the index.html and style.css files for all modification. 
The modification details are commented and deleted CSS are commented out for reference.
