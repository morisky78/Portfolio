# Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is created to make a portfolio of my work in the future to showcase my skills to employers. This page is developed applying flexbox and media queries for responsive layout, and used CSS variables so that I can easily change the color scheme in the future. Since I don't have enough showcase applicaions yet, I used placehoder images, titles, and temporary links.

## Usage

- The URL of the Deployed page:  
https://morisky78.github.io/Portfolio/

- The URL of the GitHub repository:  
https://github.com/morisky78/Portfolio


The screenshots of the page is attached below to show the layout difference in 3 different screen sizes.
